                        juniors, friends, relatives, well-wishers and valued clients who wholehearteddly revealed their
                        love and respect for me by their valuable presence and support on the Golden Jubilee Celebration

                    <p>On 22.01.2019, (after 55 years of active practice) I did not fail to remember with a sense of
                        deep my
                        mother Mrs. Thangam and my brother Mr. K.Arumugaperumal, who with great confidence in me flushed
                        out
                        money for my studies all through. My sister-in-law Mrs. Eswaravadivu and my sister K. Padmavathi
                        helped me a lot for making me a man of this stature. Above all, at home, my wife D. Renganayagi
                        has
                        created congenial atmosphere for my professional achievements.</p>

                            my
                            parents. Today is the day my
                            beloved mother’s ambition to see me a lawyer with the support of my great father got
                            fulfilled.</b></p>
                    <p>Today, I step into 56th year of practice as advocate in the Tamilnadu Bar Council. I remember my
                        brother Mr. K. Arumugha Perumal with gratitude for the unstinted support for my studies. I thank
                        God
                        for all the goodness showered on me”.</p>
                    <p>Having enrolled myself on 22.01.1969, | had to search for a senior who was well versed in law and
                        having a successful tenure. On 25.01.1969, | went to the Bar Association, Nagercoil to meet my
                        friend Mr. C. Sivaraja Pandian. Mr. R. Krishnaswamy Pillai, Senior Advocate, Mr. C. Sivaraja
                        Pandian
                        and I were sitting in the veranda of the Bar Association. I saw a ‘handsome dark man’, more
                        darkened
                        by the coat he wore, waiting for someone. I asked Mr. C. Sivaraja Pandian who he was. My friend
                        told
                        me that he was senior Advocate Mr. D. Packia Raj. Already I was advised by senior advocate Mr.
                        M.
                        Soundara Pandian, a well wisher and a relative, who was a junior of Mr.D. Packia Raj to join the
                        office of Mr. D. Pakia Raj. On seeing him, I was quite impressed. I waited for his departure
                        from
                        the Bar Association to his home nearby. I followed him and reached his office. When he saw me he
                        queried <b>“நீ யாரப்பா” I replied, “நான் B.L Pass பண்ணியிருக்கிறேன். உங்களிடம் Junior ஆக வரலாம்
                            என்று
                            ஆசைப்படுகிறேன்”. Immediately, he questioned உனக்கு எந்த ஊர், உன் அப்பா பெயர் என்ன, இங்கு
                            ஒன்னு
                            இரண்டு பேர் வரானுக. நீயும் வந்து போ..</b> The style of the private conversation was almost
                        similar to
                        the one with Perunthalaivar Kamarajar. I told my family members about this. My father was happy.
                        As
                        a businessman, he had utilized the services of many lawyers. On 29.01.1969. I joined the office
                        of
                        Thiru. D. Packiaraj, doyen of the Nagercoil Bar, connoisseur in the art of cross examination,
                        lawyer
                        of robust commonsense, versatility and intellectual acumen and I became a member of Nagercoil
                        Bar
                        reputed in many ways on the same day.</p>
                    <p>From 29.01.1969, I was regular to office and court. My punctuality and attendance in the court
                        till
                        the last judge retired to his chamber got me applause from all judicial officers. That was the
                        great
                        recognition. I used to sit with my senior till he left the office by 7.45 p.m. Never did | fail
                        to
                        attend office in the evening. My senior was also very proud of me. When I completed 6 months, I
                        started staying in Annai Lodge to concentrate more on my work, because I felt my everyday travel
                        to
                        home would take away my time.</p>
                    <p>One day my senior casually asked me,“டேய் நீ இங்கு வந்து 4 வருஷம் இருக்குமா,” “இல்லை சார், 1
                        வருடம்”
                        என பதில் கூறினேன். 4 வருஷம் practice பண்ணினது மாதிரி எனக்கு தெரியுது. அதனால் தான் என்னவோ
                        நாகர்கோவில்
                        Additional District Munsiff உயர்திரு. கணபதி ஐயர் என்னை அழைத்து சின்ன சின்ன வழக்குகளை
                        இரத்தினசாமியிடம் கொடுக்கலாமே என்று கூறினார். உனக்கும் அவருக்கும் என்னடேய்’ என்று கேட்டார். அன்று
                        முதல் money suit, execution petition என் கைக்கு வந்தது. பிரச்சனை ஏற்பட்டால் உடனடியாக உயர்திரு.
                        S.பெரியவன் அட்வகேட் அவர்களிடம் விவாதித்து நல்ல தெளிவு பெறுவேன். உயர்திரு. 5. பெரியவன்
                        உண்மையிலேயே
                        பெரியவர் கான். He was my defacto senior. He was a jolly good man with a good deal of legal
                        acumen
                        and fund of knowledge. Another eminent lawyer who exerted a powerful influence on me is Mr. G.A.
                        Jeyachandra. We used to sit up to midnight, preparing pleadings, learning and discussing legal
                        matters. My respect and salutations to him. I was attached to my senior for 6 years. I gained
                        knowledge and values immensely.</p>
                    <p>I felt like telling the event of completion of 55 years of active practice to someone in the
                        absence
                        of my father, mother, brother, sister in – l a w , sister and my younger son who departed from
                        me
                        for eternal rest. I pitched upon the District and Sessions Judge Thiru. Karuppiah whom I know
                        from
                        the days when he worked as istrict Munsiff, Valliyoor. But alas! I failed. Fortunately, I could
                        tell
                        this great event to my elder brother friend Mr. A.V. Govindarajan who resides in Coimbatore. It
                        was
                        he who enthused me to take up law to fulfil my mother’s desire. He also helped me in getting
                        acquainted with Shri. S. Mohan, Govt Pleader, as he then was who later became Judge of the
                        Madras
                        High Court and subsequently elevated to the Supreme Court of India. The conversation between me
                        and
                        Mr. A.V. Govindarajan, gave me tons of solace. I was happy that I had told this event to an apt
                        person.</p>
                    <p>When my juniors in the judiciary mooted the idea of celebrating 55 years of active practice at
                        Bar, I
                        spurned the idea for a very valid reason. Finally when the idea snowballed into a programme, the
                        1st
                        name that struck
                        my mind was Hon’ble Justice A. Ramamoorthy before whom I had the good fortune of appearing in
                        many
                        cases. He is an example of a good judge. I contacted him over phone and he readily accepted my
                        invitation. The next choice is Justice Dr. Jothymoni with whom I am well acquainted. His answer
                        was
                        encouraging. He had an arbitration sitting along with Hon’ble Justice D. Raju, judge of Supreme
                        Court (retd) and another Judge. I was informed by Justice Dr. Jothymoni that Justice Raju’s wife
                        passed waay. I telephoned him and expressed my heartfelt ondolences and consoled him, followed
                        by a
                        visit. He expressed his inability to attend the function because of grief. His one page write-up
                        with his photo wishing me, made me feel his presence in the function. Thanks to him. My
                        classmate
                        and benchmate Mr. Justice P. Shanmugam had agreed to attend the function. He was busily
                        preoccupied
                        with an important responsibility. Since the work on hand was not over, he could not attend the
                        function. I invited Justice Paul Vasanthakumar, Former Chief Justice of Jammu and Kashmir who is
                        a
                        son of our soil, He was impeccably honest. He expressed his inability to attend the function due
                        to
                        his preoccupation in Delhi.</p>

                        Advocate, who came from Thoothukudy with his family to grace the occasion. A similar good friend
                        is
                        Advocate Mr. M. Thankaraj. He has been my family friend ever since we met in the Law College
                        Hostel
                        in the year 1966. I distinctly remember that I was sitting in a corner of the marriage hall
                        saddened
                        by the untimely death of my younger son at the age of 17. It was the marriage function of Mr.
                        Thangaraj’s daughter. He came to me and held my hands and told me that I should be with him, by
                        his
                        side, as a brother, as he has no brothers. The marriage was conducted with pomp and pageantry. I
                        wonder whether anyone else can express this much concern. I salute both of them for being my
                        friends
                        for a long time.</p>
                    <p>I must make mention of Mr. P. Prabhakaran, my junior, who was camping with his family and two of
                        his
                        friends to make this celebration a special one, A.R.Jeyaruthran, practising at Madurai Bench of
                        Madras High Court and V. Palanichamy practising at Sivakasi.</p>
                    <p>My thanks are due to Mr. Keezha Pavoor Shanmugiah, Director, All India Radio (Rtd), Dr. S.
                        Chellakumar Rose, Former Principal Scott Christian College, Mr. K. Mohammed Farook, Advocate P.
                        Johnson and Engineer Mr. S. Selvaraj, who laboured hard for the success of the programme. I
                        thank
                        them profusely from the bottom of my heart. I also thank Mrs. Radhika Rajalingam who worked
                        behind
                        the screen and rendered all possible help to the organizers.</p>
                    <p>I express my sincere gratitude to Advocate Ramesh and my dear clerk S.Murugan who toiled and
                        moiled
                        several days going around the western part of the district extending invitations and soliciting
                        their support in all possible ways.</p>
                    <p>A special word should be said of my son advocate R. Prem Kumar, who meticulously managed and
                        received
                        guests. He made fine arrangements for the Hon’ble Judges and guests. I heartily appreciate his
                        organizational ability. He took great efforts on the ‘food front’. It is gratifying that he
                        received
                        accolades from the guests. Also, I am greatly indebted to my wife Renganayagi without whom I
                        will
                        not be what I am today. Her constant support and encouragement in all my activities motivated me
                        to
                        do good things in life.</p>
                    <p>I express my deep sense of gratitude to His Excellency, Justice (Rtd.) P. Sathasivam, Governor of
                        Kerala and all my well-wishers and friends who sent greetings and messages for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>I am deeply indebted to all the organizers who worked day and night to make this function a grand
                        success. Special thanks are due to Mr. Yusoof, owner of Y.R. Mahal for the kind gesture on his
                        part
                        by giving the mandapam for the function at a concessional rate.</p>
                    <p>I am very happy that I am able to sustain in the legal profession so long so well. I thank God
                        and I
                        thank there who have contributed their best in making the function a memorable and successful
                        one in
                        my career as an Advocate. I have the good fortune of having very studious, hard working and good
                        natured juniors who adorn various courts as judges. Happy to say that many of my juniors have
                        been
                        berthed in posts of responsibility and are doing commendable service to the society. I am
                        gladdened
                        to note that about 80 advocates and more than 30 apprenticeshave worked in my office. Currently,
                        I
                        am fortunate in having a team of Junior advocates, mostly ladies like A.J. Sreeja, M. Nathiya,
                        I.T.
                        Jeya Shree, M. Sherline Poornima Singh and R. Sumitha, who are also striving hard to achieve
                        laurels. My clerk Mr. S. Murugan is very efficient and intelligent. My typists Sahaya Anusha,
                        usually called Anu and R. Uma Maheswari are doing wonderful service for career development. I
                        appreciate the services of my driver Alwin@Sukumar who has been with me for the last 10 years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, May I make the following humble appeal to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and also the
                        All
                        India Bar Council, New Delhi for favour of consideration. Whereas the eminent personalities in
                        the
                        fields of medicine, education, cinema, music, sports, politics and other diversified fields are
                        being honoured, the high achievers in the legal profession go unnoticed. “A lawyer by his
                        profession
                        is an advocate of peoples rights, an expert in law and politics and one who saves the victims of
                        oppression by the State” as succinctly pointed out by Gandhiji.</p>
                    <p>Will it not be appropriate to spot out and honour advocates who have been actively practising for
                        55
                        years continuously with office, a good library of his own, juniors attending court everyday and
                        rendering service to society with the status of Designated Senior Counsel or any other
                        equivalent
                        salutation.</p>
